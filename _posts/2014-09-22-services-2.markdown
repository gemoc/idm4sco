MDE is a software engineering displine that promote the use of modeling languages to support separation of concerns and automated generation of major system artifacts (e.g., test cases, implementations) from models. Various domain-specific modeling languages and language workbenches have been recently developed among the IDM4SCO partners: the language OCELET (CIRAD) to model spacial dynamics, the language KENDRICK (IRD) for epidemiological modelign and simulation,the Eclipse GEMOC Studio (Inria / Univ. Toulouse), incl. a specific application to farming system modeling (INRIA/INRA/Obeo), farming modeling (IRSTEA).
